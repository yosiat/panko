# Panko

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yosiat/panko_serializer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yosiat/panko_serializer)

Panko is library which is inspired by ActiveModelSerializers 0.9 for serializing ActiveRecord objects to JSON strings, fast.

To achieve it's performance:

* Oj - Panko relies Oj since it's fast and allow to to serialize incrementally using `Oj::StringWriter`
* Serialization Descriptor - Panko computes most of the metadata ahead of time, to save time later in serialization.
* Type casting â€” Panko does type casting by it's self, instead of relying ActiveRecord.
